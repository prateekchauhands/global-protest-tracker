# Global Protests Tracker

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the anti-government protests across the world from 2017-2024. The data is sourced from the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace website and has been processed using Excel and Power Query Editor to create a database for easy management and analysis. Looker Studio has been used to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data for worldwide anti-government protests for the period 2017-2024. The data has been sourced from the [Carnegie Endowment For International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/interactive/protest-tracker) website, which ensures its authenticity and reliability. The dataset includes information such as country, protest name, size category, key participants, triggers, motivations, outcomes, and time period (start date, duration, year).

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace website requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Excel and Power Query Editor have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Excel and Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

Looker Studio: For data analysis and visualization.

## Key Highlights
#### **Why People Are Protesting Against Their Governments?**

The world is witnessing a surge of anti-government protests, from Hong Kong to Belarus, from Chile to Sudan, from India to France. Millions of people are taking to the streets, demanding change, justice, and democracy. What is driving this wave of discontent, and what are its consequences?

According to the data analyzed, there were 72 anti-government protest movements in 2020, down slightly from 2019, but significantly higher than the pre-pandemic count in 2018. The main causes of these protests vary from country to country, but some common themes emerge: inequality, corruption, repression, and poor governance. Many protesters are frustrated by the lack of economic opportunities, social services, and political representation. They are also angry at the perceived or real subversion of democracy by authoritarian leaders, rigged elections, or constitutional changes.

The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated these grievances, as well as created new ones. The pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of public health systems, worsened the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable, and triggered harsh lockdown measures that have curtailed civil liberties and human rights. Some governments have also used the crisis as an excuse to crack down on dissent, silence critics, and consolidate power.

The future of these protests is uncertain, as they face many challenges and risks. Some may lose momentum, co-optation, or fragmentation. Some may escalate into civil war, as in Syria, Libya, or Yemen. Some may trigger external intervention, as in Belarus, Venezuela, or Ethiopia. Some may also inspire more protests in other countries, creating a domino effect or a global movement.

What is clear, however, is that these protests are a sign of a deep and widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo, and a desire for a more just and democratic world. They are also a test for the resilience and legitimacy of governments, and their ability to respond to the demands and aspirations of their people. The rise of global dissent is not a passing phenomenon, but a defining feature of our times.
